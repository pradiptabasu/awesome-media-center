Media center using docker-compose with Traefik, Portainer, Nextcloud and Emby.

## Overview

Traefik acts as a reverse proxy to expose the running docker containers, exposes ports 80 and 443. Port 80 redirects all the requests to 443, to enforce HTTPS. Services are registered as dynamic DNS entries in the host machine, that maps a subdomain for the respective container ip. Additionally, each service is SSL certified, managed by Traefik using Letsencrypt.

## Prerequisites

* Domain, with the subdomains registered
* Server
* Docker and docker-compose

## Installation

Each of the services is represented by a docker stack, containing a *docker-compose.yml*. For the installation to be more manageable, the only two service deployed by docker cli are [traefik](#traefik) and [portainer](#portainer). The remaining services will be deployed using [portainer](#portainer) to easily manage the stacks.

First, run trafik:
```sh
$ cd trafik
$ docker-compose pull && docker-compose up -d
```

Next, run the portainer:
```sh
$ cd portainer
$ docker-compose pull && docker-compose up -d
```

Now, that portainer is already up and running, we just add the stacks on portainer dashboard, by adding each of the docker-compose files.

Any issue with the installation should refer to the [problems](#problems) section.

### <a name="traefik"></a> Traefik

On the *docker-compose.yml* one should change the property *basicauth.users*. The password should be generated by *htpasswd*, and for each character "$" should be escaped by inserting another "$" character.

#### Traefik upgrade

```sh
$ docker pull traefik
$ cd traefik
$ docker stop traefik
$ docker rm traefik 
$ docker-compose up -d
```

### <a name="portainer"></a> Portainer

Should be deployed using portainer under stacks.

#### Portainer upgrade

```sh
$ docker pull portainer/portainer-ce
$ cd portainer
$ docker stop portainer
$ docker rm portainer 
$ docker-compose up -d
```

### Nextcloud

Should be deployed using portainer under stacks.

To setup wizard requires the following credentials:
* *user* - nextcloud
* *password* - secret
* *database* - nextcloud
* *host* - db:3306

#### Nextcloud upgrade

Since nextcloud is managed by the Portainer, we could just recreate the stack, and portainer will automatically fetch the latest image and recreate it. 

```sh
$ docker pull nextcloud/nextcloud
$ cd nextcloud
$ docker stop nextcloud
$ docker rm nextcloud 
$ docker-compose up -d
```

### Emby

Should be deployed using portainer under stacks.

The volumes should be changed to match the wanted mount. The *UID* and *GID* on the environment are described in the section [User ID and Group ID](#user). 

#### Emby upgrade

Since emby is managed by the Portainer, we could just recreate the stack, and portainer will automatically fetch the latest image and recreate it. 

```sh
$ docker pull emby/emby
$ cd emby
$ docker stop emby
$ docker rm emby 
$ docker-compose up -d
```

#### Emby Backup

This command will backup the config folder from emby, mounted as an external volume, and create a backup.tar file in your home folder. 
```sh
$ cd ~
$ docker run --rm --volumes-from emby -v $(pwd):/backup ubuntu tar cvf /backup/backup.tar /config
```

#### Emby Restore Backup

On a new container from the same host machine or a different host, you can recreate the same volume as backup by the previous command.
```sh
$ cd ~
$ docker run --rm --volumes-from emby -v $(pwd):/backup ubuntu bash -c "cd /config && tar xvf /backup/backup.tar --strip 1"
```

### Transmission

Should be deployed using portainer under stacks.

The volumes should be changed to match the wanted mount. The *PUID* and *PGID* on the environment are described in the section [User ID and Group ID](#user).

#### Transmission upgrade

Since transmission is managed by the Portainer, we could just recreate the stack, and portainer will automatically fetch the latest image and recreate it. 

```sh
$ docker pull transmission/transmission
$ cd transmission
$ docker stop transmission
$ docker rm transmission 
$ docker-compose up -d
```

### <a name="user"></a> User ID and Group ID

With the user you're running docker run:
```sh
$ id -u
```
returns UID for the user, and
```sh
$ id -g
```
returns GID for the user.

## <a name="problems"></a> Problems

Permissions on *data/acme.json* are too open then run:
```sh
$ chmod 600 acme.json
```
